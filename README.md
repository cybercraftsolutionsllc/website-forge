# 🚀 WebsiteForge

**Automated demo website generator for local businesses.**

WebsiteForge finds small businesses that need a better web presence, generates a custom landing page demo, and deploys it live — all in one click.

Built as a Google Apps Script pipeline powered by your choice of LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or xAI).

## How It Works

1. **Research** — AI finds a real local business with a weak or missing website
2. **Build** — Generates a premium, mobile-responsive landing page with contextual imagery
3. **Deploy** — Pushes the demo live to GitHub Pages
4. **Log** — Records everything to Google Sheets for review and outreach

## Demo Sites

Generated demos are hosted under [`/demos`](./demos). Each subfolder contains a standalone `index.html` landing page.
